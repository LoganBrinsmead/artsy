This is a react-native application that is meant as an open-source center for collecting and appreciating artwork from multiple museums and other sources. With an easily extendable API for collecting the art, it's simple to add new artwork sources to Artsy.

This application is still under development but a very rough MVP is available under the frontend-v1 branch.
